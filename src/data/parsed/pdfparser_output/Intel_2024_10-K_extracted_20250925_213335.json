CCG revenue decreased 8% due to lower notebook and desktop\nvolume from lower demand across market segments, partially offset by increased volume in the second half of the year as customer\ninventory levels normalized compared to higher levels in the first half. Notebook ASPs decreased due to a higher mix of small core\nproducts combined with a higher mix of older generation products. This was partially offset by higher desktop ASPs due to an increased\nmix of product sales to the commercial and gaming market segments. DCAI revenue decreased 20% due to lower server volume\nresulting from a softening CPU data center market, partially offset by higher ASPs from a lower mix of hyperscale customer-related\nrevenue and a higher mix of high core count products. NEX revenue decreased 31% as customers tempered purchases to reduce\ninventories and adjust to a lower demand environment across product lines.

To achieve our long-term financial model, we believe it is imperative that we drive to world-class product\ncost and operational efficiency. A key component of our overall strategy is our internal foundry model. Under this model, we intend to reshape our operational dynamics and\nestablish transparency and accountability through standalone profit and loss reporting for our manufacturing group in 2024. We expect this model to enable increased efficiencies\nacross a number of aspects of our organization that we believe are integral to achieving our financial and operational goals.

As we look ahead to the next decade, we expect to see\ncontinued demand for processing power. Semiconductors are the underlying technology powering this digital expansion, and we are strategically positioning ourselves to create\na resilient global semiconductor supply chain by investing in geographically balanced manufacturing capacity. The demand for compute is being accelerated by five superpowers:\nubiquitous compute, pervasive connectivity, cloud-to-edge infrastructure, AI, and sensing. Together these superpowers combine to amplify and reinforce each other, and will\nexponentially increase the world's need for computing by packing even more processing capability onto ever-smaller microchips. We intend to lead the industry by harnessing\nthese superpowers for our customers' growth and our own.\nWe are uniquely positioned with the depth and breadth of our silicon, platforms, and software, and packaging and process technology with at-scale manufacturing. With these\nstrengths and the tailwinds of the superpowers driving digital disruption, our strategy to win is focused on four key themes: product leadership, open platforms, manufacturing at\nscale, and our people.\nOur Priorities\nProduct Leadership\nLead and democratize compute with Intel x86 and xPU. Our product offerings provide end-to-end solutions, scaling from data center to network, PCs, edge computing, and the\nemerging fields of AI and autonomous driving, to serve an increasingly smart and connected world.\nAt our core is the x86 computing ecosystem, which supports an extensive and deep universe of software applications, with billions of lines of code written and optimized for x86\nCPUs. We continue to advance this ecosystem with x86 microarchitectures focused on performance, which push the limits of low latency and single-threaded application\nperformance, and microarchitectures focused on efficiency, which are designed for computing throughput efficiency to enable scalable multithreaded performance.\nBeyond the CPU, we are delivering a growing family of xPU products, which encompass client and data center GPUs, IPUs, FPGAs, and other accelerators. The xPU approach\nrecognizes that different workloads benefit from different computing architectures, and our broad portfolio helps meet our customers' increasingly diverse computing needs. As\npart of our strategy, we seek to develop and offer leading products across each of these architectural categories.\nWe also seek to address every phase of the AI continuum, including the largest, most challenging GenAI and large language models. We believe AI represents a generational\nshift in computing by expanding human abilities and solving the most challenging problems. We are in the early stages of realizing AI's full potential and GenAI is just the\nbeginning. Our strategy is to bring AI to where the data is being generated and used and we believe we have a full spectrum of hardware and software platforms, offering open\nand modular solutions, for competitive total cost of ownership and time to value that customers need to win in this era of exponential growth and AI everywhere. We are infusing\nAI into Intel technologies, supporting today's GenAI workloads, fueling emerging usages like AI PC and AI at the edge, and pioneering innovations that we believe advance the\nfuture of AI in the next decade. We believe our leadership in IP, process, packaging, security, software, services, manufacturing, and foundry services positions us to realize AI's\nfull potential to transform industries and solve the world's biggest challenges.\nFundamentals of Our Business 7",

      "text": "Table of Contents\nOpen Platforms\nWe aim to deliver open software and hardware platforms with industry-defining standards. Around the globe, companies are building their networks, systems, and solutions on\nopen standards-based platforms. Intel has helped set the stage for this movement, with our historic contributions in developing standards such as CXL, Thunderbolt™, and PCI\nExpress*. We also contributed to the design, build, and validation of open-source products in the industry such as Linux*, Android*, and others. The world's developers constantly\ninnovate and expand the capabilities of these open platforms while increasing their stability, reliability, and security. In addition, microservices have enabled the development of\nflexible, loosely coupled services that are connected via application programming interfaces to create end-to-end processes. We use industry collaboration, co-engineering, and\nopen-source contributions to accelerate software innovation. Through our oneAPI initiative, developers use a unified language across CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs that is designed\nto reduce development time and to enhance productivity. We also deliver a steady stream of open-source code and optimizations that are designed for projects across virtually\nevery platform and usage model. We are committed to co-engineering and jointly designing, building, and validating new products with software industry leaders to accelerate\nmutual technology advancements and help new software and hardware work better together. Our commitment extends to developers through our developer-first approach based\non openness, choice, and trust.\nUltimately, we believe our pivot to a software-defined, silicon-enhanced strategy will enable us to realize value at all layers of the compute stack. This should allow us to continue\nto monetize foundational and ecosystem-enabling software through hardware sales, limited licensing, and customer-enabling service offerings. Additionally, we are expanding our\nsoftware portfolio by developing and monetizing software solutions, services, and platforms with SaaS, software subscriptions, and other business models. We are prioritizing\nthree portfolios of offerings for our SaaS and subscription-based software: AI, trust and security, and performance optimization. We are also scaling the availability of Intel®\nDeveloper Cloud, which is designed to enable developers to learn, prototype, test, and run their own AI workloads across multiple Intel hardware architectures to experience the\ncompetitive performance of Intel platforms and develop their AI software from today’s hardware portfolio to next-generation architectures.\nAn open approach and deep engagement with the developer ecosystem are essential to lowering barriers to entry and unlocking AI innovations for developers and customers.\nWe are expediting an open AI software ecosystem that we believe is needed to break down proprietary walls. We offer customers, partners, and developers early access and a\nrapid path to scale their AI solutions with the Intel Developer Cloud and integrated and scalable hardware and software systems and solutions.\nWe believe AI will only be truly accessible to all when its use is ethical and responsible. Partnering with industry leaders, we are working to deliver innovative ecosystem tools\nand solutions intended to make AI safer and more secure, and help address privacy concerns as AI scales exponentially. We are building platforms and technologies for the\nconvergence of AI and security to help customers confidently secure diverse AI workloads across the data center, cloud, PC, and edge.\nManufacturing at Scale\nIDM 2.0, the next evolution and expansion of our IDM model, is a differentiated strategy that combines three capabilities:\nInternal factory network. Our global, internal factory network has been foundational to our success, enabling product optimization, improved economics, and supply resilience.\nWe intend to remain a leading developer of process technology and a major manufacturer of semiconductors and will continue to build the majority of our products in our\nfactories.\nStrategic use of foundry capacity. We expect to expand our use of third-party foundry manufacturing capacity, which will provide us with increased flexibility and scale to optimize\nour product roadmaps for cost, performance, schedule, and supply. Our use of foundry capacity will include manufacturing for a range of modular tiles on advanced process\ntechnologies.\nOpen System Foundry. We are building a world-class foundry business to meet the growing long-term global demand for semiconductors. We plan to differentiate our foundry\nofferings from those of others through a combination of leading-edge packaging and process technology, committed capacity in the US and Europe available for customers\nglobally, and a world-class IP portfolio that will include x86 cores, as well as other ecosystem IP. The current foundry model enabled explosion of ecosystem innovation at the\nwafer level. We believe this established model has historically served the industry well, but a new mindset is needed in our new era of chipmaking. As innovation evolves, we see\nthe rack has collapsed into a system and the system has collapsed into an advanced package. We are building out an Open System Foundry that has four components: wafer\nfabrication, packaging, chiplet standard, and software.\nThe Open System Foundry involves engaging with customers at multiple levels, from basic wafer manufacturing to helping define and implement their desired system\narchitectures. We intend to build our customers' silicon designs and deliver full end-to-end customizable products built with our advanced packaging technology.\nWe believe our IDM 2.0 strategy enables us to deliver leading process technology and products to meet growing long-term demand using internal and external capacity, while\nleveraging our core strengths to provide foundry services to others and providing superior capacity, supply resilience, and an advantageous cost structure.\nIn the upcoming year, we plan to implement an internal foundry model, where our business units engage with our manufacturing group in an arm's-length fashion, similar to how\nfabless semiconductor companies engage with external foundries. The model is integral to our IDM 2.0 operational and financial strategies and aims to fully leverage our\ninvested capital while serving a wide variety of chip customers worldwide.\nFundamentals of Our Business 8",

The key elements of Smart Capital include:\n▪ Smart capacity investments. We are aggressively building out manufacturing shell space, which gives us flexibility in how and when we bring additional capacity online\nbased on milestone triggers such as product readiness, market conditions, and customer commitments.\n▪ Government incentives. We are continuing to work with governments in the US and Europe to advance and benefit from incentives for domestic manufacturing capacity\nfor leading-edge semiconductors.\n▪ SCIP. We are accessing strategically aligned capital to increase our flexibility and help efficiently accelerate and scale manufacturing build-outs. This type of co-\ninvestment also demonstrates how private capital is unlocked and becomes a force multiplier for government incentives for semiconductor manufacturing expansion.\n▪ Customer commitments. IFS is working closely with potential customers to make advance payments to secure capacity. This provides us with the advantage of\ncommitted volume, de-risking investments while providing capacity corridors for our foundry customers.\n▪ External foundries. We intend to continue our use of external foundries where their unique capabilities support our leadership products.\nFundamentals of Our Business 9",

We also seek to pay competitive dividends, optimize our portfolio, look for innovative ways to unlock value across our assets, and,\nfrom time-to-time, engage in mergers and acquisitions. As we invest in our IDM 2.0 strategy and implement our next phase of capacity expansions and the acceleration of our\nprocess technology roadmap, our allocation priorities have shifted more heavily toward investing in the business and away from stock repurchases. In the long term, we will\ncontinue to look for opportunities to further our strategy through acquisitions while remaining disciplined on capital allocation.\nCash from Operating Activities $B\n■ Cash from Operating Activities ■ Adjusted Free Cash Flow1\nOur Financial Capital Allocation Strategy\nInvest in the Business\nOur first allocation priority is to invest in R&D and capital spending to capitalize on the opportunity presented by the world's demand for semiconductors. In 2023, we continued\nour focus on capital investment and the deployment of our Smart Capital strategy.\nReturn Excess Cash to Stockholders\nOur capital allocation strategy includes returning excess cash to stockholders. We achieve this through our dividend policy and, when permissible, stock repurchases. In 2023,\nwe declared a reduced quarterly dividend on our common stock. This dividend reduction reflects our deliberate approach to capital allocation, is expected to support the critical\ninvestments needed to execute our business strategy, and is designed to position us to create long-term value. We expect future stock repurchases to continue to be curtailed\nduring this time of meaningful investment in capital.\nR&D and Capital Investments $B Cash to Stockholders $B\n■ R&D ■ Logic ■ Memory2 ■ Repurchases ■ Dividend\nOptimize our Portfolio and Unlock Value\nOur capital allocation strategy also includes opportunistic investment in and acquisition of companies that complement our strategic objectives. We look for acquisitions that\nsupplement and strengthen our capital and R&D investments.\nWe also seek to drive value creation through transactions such as the 2022 Mobileye IPO, the 2023 minority stake sales in IMS, and the 2023 announcement of our intent to\noperate PSG as a standalone business which we expect to enable potential private and public equity investments. Together, these transactions provide an additional source of\ncapital to support the critical investments needed to advance our business strategy.\nLastly, we take action when investments do not strategically align to our key priorities. In the last three years, we exited numerous businesses, including the NAND memory\nbusiness and Intel® Optane™ memory business.\n1 See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" within MD&A.\n2 2021-2023 capital investments in Memory are not presented due to the divestiture of the NAND memory business announced in October 2020. 2019 and 2020 capital investments presented include\nMemory.\nFundamentals of Our Business Our Capital 11",

Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are in\ninvestment-grade securities.\nOur sources of liquidity in 2023 included $1.5 billion from partner contributions, net proceeds of $1.6 billion from a secondary offering of Mobileye Class A common stock,\n$1.4 billion of cash proceeds from the sale of minority stakes in our IMS business to both Bain Capital and TSMC, and government incentives of $1.0 billion. Other potential\nsources of liquidity include our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified\namount of debt, equity, other securities, and non-recourse factoring arrangements with third-party financial institutions. Under our commercial paper program, we have an\nongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $10.0 billion and, as of December 30, 2023, we had no commercial paper obligations outstanding. During 2023,\nwe issued a total of $11.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, refinancing our outstanding debt and\nfunding for working capital and capital expenditures. We also amended both our five-year $5.0 billion variable-rate revolving credit facility agreement, extending that maturity date\nby one year to March 2028, and our 364-day $5.0 billion credit facility agreement, extending the maturity date to March 2024. As of December 30, 2023, we had no borrowings\noutstanding on the revolving credit facilities.\nIn Q1 2023, we declared a reduced quarterly dividend on our common stock. This dividend reduction reflects our deliberate approach to capital allocation, is expected to support\nthe critical investments needed to execute our business strategy, and is designed to position us to create long-term value. In January 2024, our Board of Directors declared a\nquarterly dividend of $0.125 per share on the company's common stock, which will be payable on March 1, 2024 to stockholders of record as of February 7, 2024. Future\ndeclarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.\nOur cash and investments and related cash flows may be affected by certain discretionary actions we may take with customers and suppliers to accelerate or delay certain cash\nreceipts or payments to manage liquidity, among other factors, for our strategic business requirements. In 2023 these actions included, among others, negotiating with suppliers\nto optimize our payment terms and conditions, adjusting the amounts and timing of cash flows associated with customer sales programs and collections, managing inventory\nlevels and purchasing practices, and selling certain of our accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions. While such actions have benefited, and\nmay further benefit, cash flow in the near term, we may experience a corresponding detriment to cash flow in future periods as these actions cease or as the impacts of these\nactions reverse or normalize.\nOur cash flows for each period were as follows:\nYears Ended (In Millions) Dec 30, 2023 Dec 31, 2022 Dec 25, 2021\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 11,471 $ 15,433 $ 29,456\nNet cash used for investing activities (24,041) (10,231) (24,283)\nNet cash provided by (used for) financing activities 8,505 1,115 (6,211)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (4,065) $ 6,317 $ (1,038)\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.\nFor 2023 compared to 2022, the $4.0 billion decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by lower 2023 net income after adjusting for non-cash items,\npartially offset by 2023 cash-favorable working capital changes compared to 2022.\nFor 2022 compared to 2021, the $14.0 billion decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by lower 2022 net income after adjusting for non-cash items,\nincluding the gain on the sale of McAfee and the pre-tax gain from the divestiture of our NAND business, partially offset by 2022 cash-favorable working capital changes\ncompared to 2021.\nMD&A 43",

We believe these non-\nGAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about our operating performance, enable comparison of financial trends and results between\nperiods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating\nour business and measuring our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in our performance-based RSUs and our cash bonus plans.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items, as well as the related income tax effects. Beginning in 2023, income tax\neffects are calculated using a fixed long-term projected tax rate of 13% across all adjustments. We project this long-term non-GAAP tax rate on an annual basis using a five-year\nnon-GAAP financial projection that excludes the income tax effects of each adjustment. The projected non-GAAP tax rate also considers factors such as our tax structure, our tax\npositions in various jurisdictions, and key legislation in significant jurisdictions where we operate. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate may be subject to change for a variety of\nreasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix, or changes to our strategy or business operations.\nManagement uses this non-GAAP tax rate in managing internal short- and long-term operating plans and in evaluating our performance; we believe this approach facilitates\ncomparison of our operating results and provides useful evaluation of our current operating performance. Prior-period non-GAAP financial measures have been retroactively\nadjusted to reflect this updated approach.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results\ncalculated in accordance with US GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.\nNon-GAAP adjustment\nor measure Definition Usefulness to management and investors\nNAND memory business We completed the first closing of the divestiture of our NAND memory We exclude the impact of our NAND memory business in certain non-\nbusiness to SK hynix on December 29, 2021 and fully deconsolidated our GAAP measures.

In our Consolidated Financial Statements, we treat shares of common stock withheld for tax purposes on behalf of our\nemployees in connection with the vesting of RSUs as common stock repurchases because they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. These\nwithheld shares of common stock are not considered common stock repurchases under our authorized common stock repurchase program.\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Arrangements\nOur directors and officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act) may from time to time enter into plans or other arrangements for the purchase or sale of our shares\nthat are intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5–1(c) or may represent a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement under the Exchange Act. During the\nquarter ended December 30, 2023, no such plans or arrangements were adopted or terminated, including by modification.\nRisk Factors and Other Key Information 67",
