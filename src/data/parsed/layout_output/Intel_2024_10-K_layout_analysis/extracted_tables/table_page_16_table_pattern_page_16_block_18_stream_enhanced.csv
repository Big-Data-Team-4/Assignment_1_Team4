This non-GAAP financial measure is helpful in understanding our capital
requirements and sources of liquidity by providing an additional means to
"evaluate the cash flow trends of our business. Since the 2017 divestiture,"
McAfee equity distributions and sales contributed to prior operating and
"free cash flow, and while the McAfee equity sale in Q1 2022 would have"
"typically been excluded from adjusted free cash flow as an equity sale, we"
believe including the sale proceeds in adjusted free cash flow facilitate a
"better, more consistent comparison to current and past presentations of"
liquidity.
This non-GAAP measure is helpful in understanding our capital resources
and liquidity position.
