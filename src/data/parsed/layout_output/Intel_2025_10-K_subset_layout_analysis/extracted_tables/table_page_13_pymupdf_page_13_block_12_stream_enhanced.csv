Financing Activities
"Financing cash flows consist primarily of proceeds from strategic initiatives, including partner contributions and equity-related issuances, issuance and repayment of short-term"
"and long-term debt, financing for capital expenditures with non-standard payment terms, and payment of dividends to stockholders."
"The increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to higher SCIP partner contributions, reduced dividend payments, and other"
"cash favorable financing activities in 2024. These 2024 cash favorable financing activities were partially offset by lower proceeds from debt issuances, net of repayments; the"
absence of proceeds from sales of subsidiary shares; and higher financing for capital expenditures with non-standard payment terms in 2024.
