"To help us execute toward our IDM 0 strategy, we are leveraging our Smart Capital approach. This approach is designed to enable us to adjust quickly to opportunities in the
market, while managing our margin structure and capital spending. The key elements of Smart Capital include:",
▪,"Smart capacity investments. We are aggressively building out manufacturing shell space, which gives us flexibility in how and when we bring additional capacity online
based on milestone triggers such as product readiness, market conditions, and customer commitments."
▪,"Government incentives. We are continuing to work with governments in the US and Europe to advance and benefit from incentives for domestic manufacturing capacity
for leading-edge semiconductors."
▪,"SCIP. We are accessing strategically aligned capital to increase our flexibility and help efficiently accelerate and scale manufacturing build-outs. This type of co-
investment also demonstrates how private capital is unlocked and becomes a force multiplier for government incentives for semiconductor manufacturing expansion."
▪,"Customer commitments. IFS is working closely with potential customers to make advance payments to secure capacity. This provides us with the advantage of
committed volume, de-risking investments while providing capacity corridors for our foundry customers."
▪,External foundries. We intend to continue our use of external foundries where their unique capabilities support our leadership products.
