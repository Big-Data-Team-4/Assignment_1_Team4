While the second closing of the sale is still pending andsubject to closing conditions, we deconsolidated this business in Q1 2022and management does not view the historical results of the business as apart of our core operations. We believe these adjustments provideinvestors with a useful view, through the eyes of management, of our corebusiness model and how management currently evaluates coreoperational performance. In making these adjustments, we have not madeany changes to our methods for measuring and calculating revenue orother financial statement amounts."
