▪,"Intel 4, our first EUV lithography node, delivers significant density scaling and approximately 20% performance-per-watt improvement over Intel The Intel Core Ultra
processor is our first high-volume client product on Intel 4 and began shipping to customers in Intel 4 moved to high-volume manufacturing in Ireland in 2024, and"
,is expected to represent an increasing portion of our processor production and products in 
▪,"Intel 3, our second EUV lithography node, delivers further logic scaling and up to 18% performance-per-watt improvement over Intel Intel 3 is offered to external
foundry customers and is optimized for the needs of data center products. This node, which is produced in the same facilities as Intel 4, was in high-volume"
,"manufacturing in Oregon during 2024, with high-volume manufacturing shifted to Ireland for Intel’s Xeon 6 Scalable server processor offerings are built on this
technology."
▪,"Intel 18A is our next generation leading-edge process technology and has been designed to incorporate the first high volume commercial implementation of two
breakthrough technologies: gate-all-around transistors and backside power. RibbonFET, our implementation of a gate-all-around transistor, is designed to deliver faster"
,"transistor switching speeds while achieving the same drive current as multiple fins, but in a smaller footprint. PowerVia is our unique industry-first implementation of
backside power delivery that is designed to optimize signal transmission by eliminating the need for power routing on the front side of the wafer. Intel 18A is offered to"
,"external foundry customers and is designed to deliver improvements in performance per watt and density scaling over Intel We expect to commence high-volume
manufacturing of Panther Lake, our new client family of products and our first processors on Intel 18A, in "
▪,"Intel 14A, our third advanced process technology offering to external customers, is in active development with performance-per-watt and density scaling improvements
over Intel 18A."
