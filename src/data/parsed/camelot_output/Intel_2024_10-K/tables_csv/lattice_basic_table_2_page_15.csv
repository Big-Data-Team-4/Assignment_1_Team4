"Non-GAAP adjustment
or measure",Definition,Usefulness to management and investors
NAND memory business We completed the first closing of the divestiture of our NAND memory,"business to SK hynix on December 29, 2021 and fully deconsolidated our
ongoing interests in the NAND OpCo Business in Q1 ","We exclude the impact of our NAND memory business in certain non-
GAAP measures. While the second closing of the sale is still pending and
subject to closing conditions, we deconsolidated this business in Q1 2022
and management does not view the historical results of the business as a
part of our core operations. We believe these adjustments provide
investors with a useful view, through the eyes of management, of our core
business model and how management currently evaluates core
operational performance. In making these adjustments, we have not made
any changes to our methods for measuring and calculating revenue or
other financial statement amounts."
"Acquisition-related
adjustments","Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets consists of
amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, brands,
and customer relationships acquired in connection with business
combinations. Charges related to the amortization of these intangibles are
recorded within both cost of sales and MG&A in our US GAAP financial
statements. Amortization charges are recorded over the estimated useful
life of the related acquired intangible asset, and thus are generally
recorded over multiple years.","We exclude amortization charges for our acquisition-related intangible
assets for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because
these charges are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by
the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. These adjustments facilitate a
useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to
our past operating performance and provide investors with additional
means to evaluate cost and expense trends."
"Share-based
compensation","Share-based compensation consists of charges related to our employee
equity incentive plans.","We exclude charges related to share-based compensation for purposes of
calculating certain non-GAAP measures because we believe these
adjustments provide better comparability to peer company results and
because these charges are not viewed by management as part of our core
operating performance. We believe these adjustments provide investors
with a useful view, through the eyes of management, of our core business
model, how management currently evaluates core operational
performance, and additional means to evaluate expense trends, including
in comparison to other peer companies."
