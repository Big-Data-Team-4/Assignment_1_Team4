## Fundamentals of Our Business

We are a global designer and manufacturer of semiconductor products. The CPUs and other semiconductor solutions that we design, manufacture, market, and sell are incorporated in computing and related end products and services, and utilized globally by consumers, enterprises, governments, and educational organizations. Customers of our semiconductor products primarily include OEMs, ODMs, cloud service providers, and other manufacturers and service providers, such as industrial and communication equipment manufacturers and other cloud service providers who buy our products through distributor, reseller, retail, and OEM channels throughout the world. We market and sell our semiconductor products directly through our global sales and marketing organizations and indirectly through channel partners. We also develop semiconductor fabrication process and packaging technologies and manufacture many of our semiconductor product offerings at our geographically diverse network of fabrication and assembly and test facilities. We are also seeking to expand as a third-party foundry for external customers.

## Our Strategy

Technology permeates every aspect of our lives and is increasingly central to every aspect of human existence. As we look ahead to the next decade, we expect to see continued demand for processing power. Semiconductors are the underlying technology powering this digital expansion, and we are strategically positioning ourselves to create a resilient global semiconductor supply chain by investing in geographically balanced manufacturing capacity. The demand for compute is being accelerated by five superpowers: ubiquitous compute, pervasive connectivity, cloud-to-edge infrastructure, AI, and sensing. Together, these superpowers combine to amplify and reinforce each other, and increase the world's need for computing by packing even more processing capability onto ever-smaller microchips. We harness these superpowers for our customers' growth and our own.

We are uniquely positioned with the depth and breadth of our silicon, platforms, software, and packaging and process technology with at-scale manufacturing. With these strengths and the tailwinds of the superpowers driving digital disruption, our strategy to win is focused on four key themes: product competitiveness, open platforms, manufacturing at scale, and our people.

## Our Priorities

## Product Competitiveness

Lead and democratize compute with Intel x86 and xPU. Our product offerings provide end-to-end solutions, scaling from data center to network, PCs, edge computing, and the emerging fields of AI and autonomous driving, to serve an increasingly smart and connected world.

At our core is the x86 ecosystem, which has served as a foundation of modern computing for over four decades. We continue to advance this ecosystem with x86 microarchitectures focused on performance and efficiency. In 2024, we announced the creation of an advisory group to expand the x86 ecosystem by enabling compatibility across platforms, simplifying software development, and providing developers with a platform to identify architectural needs and features to create innovative and scalable solutions for the future.

Beyond the CPU, we deliver a family of xPU products encompassing client and data center GPUs, IPUs, FPGAs, and other accelerators. The xPU approach recognizes that different workloads benefit from different computing architectures, and our broad portfolio helps meet our customers' increasingly diverse computing needs. As part of our strategy, we seek to develop and offer leading products across each of these architectural categories.

We also seek to address every phase of the AI continuum, from the largest, most challenging GenAI and large language models to emerging usages like AI PCs and AI at the edge. We believe AI represents a generational shift in computing by expanding human abilities and solving the most challenging problems. We are in the early stages of realizing AI's full potential. Our strategy is to bring AI to where the data is being generated and used. We believe we have a full spectrum of hardware and software platforms that offer the open and modular solutions for competitive total cost of ownership and time to value that customers need to win in this era of exponential growth and AI everywhere. We are infusing AI into Intel technologies, supporting today's GenAI workloads, fueling emerging usages like AI PC and AI at the edge, and pioneering innovations that we believe will help advance the future of AI in the next decade.

Our product offerings are predominantly manufactured in our own manufacturing facilities using our proprietary process technologies. In recent years, however, we have strategically utilized third-party foundry manufacturing capacity where advantageous for cost, performance, schedule, or other reasons. This provides increased flexibility and scale, including in recent years the ability to continue to offer various products at the most performant end of the product spectrum where we did not yet have comparable process technologies in-house.

## Open Platforms

We aim to deliver open software and hardware platforms with industry-defining standards. Around the globe, companies are building their networks, systems, and solutions on open standards-based platforms. We have helped set the stage for this movement, with our historic contributions in developing standards such as CXL, Thunderbolt™, and PCI Express. We also contributed to the design, build, and validation of open-source products in the industry such as Linux, Android, and others.

We deliver open-source code and optimizations that are designed for projects across numerous platforms and usage models. We are committed to co-engineering and jointly designing, building, and validating new products with software industry leaders to accelerate mutual technology advancements and help software and hardware work better together.

## Manufacturing at Scale

We manufacture a majority of our products in our own manufacturing facilities using our proprietary process technologies. This enables us to optimize performance, shorten timeto-market for new product introductions, and more quickly scale products in high volume.

Process technology. We continue to develop new generations of manufacturing process technology as we seek to realize the benefits from Moore's Law, a law of economics predicted by Intel's cofounder Gordon Moore more than 50 years ago. Realizing Moore's Law results in economic benefits as we are able to either reduce a chip's cost as we shrink its size or increase functionality and performance of a chip while maintaining the same cost with higher density. This makes possible the innovation of new products with higher performance while balancing power efficiency, cost, and size to meet customers' needs. As of the end of 2024, our core products were manufactured on 300mm wafers, with a significant majority manufactured using our Intel 7 process node while we ramped our Intel 4 and Intel 3 process nodes into high volume.

Factory network. Our global factory network has been foundational to our success, enabling product optimization, improved economics, and supply resilience. We operate wafer manufacturing facilities in the United States (Oregon and Arizona), Ireland, and Israel, assembly and testing facilities in Costa Rica, China, Malaysia, and Vietnam, and packaging facilities in the United States (New Mexico), Costa Rica, Vietnam, and Malaysia. We intend to remain a leading developer of process technology and a major manufacturer of semiconductors and we plan to continue to build the majority of our products in our factories.

Foundry services. The very high capital requirements of modern leading-edge semiconductor process technology development and manufacturing, especially those nodes requiring EUV lithography such as Intel 4, Intel 3, Intel 18A and future nodes, require us to expand the use of our process technologies as they mature and grow the number of wafers produced beyond the expected growth for our own products. To this end, we are seeking to build a world-class foundry business also serving external customers and have made significant investments in ecosystem support to enable the usage of our manufacturing network by external customers. Our foundry offerings include four components: wafer fabrication, packaging, chiplets, and software and services. We intend to build our customers' silicon designs and deliver full end-to-end customizable products built with our advanced packaging technology. We plan to differentiate our foundry offerings from those of others through a combination of leading-edge packaging and process technology, committed capacity in the US and Europe available for customers globally, and a world-class IP portfolio that will include x86 cores, as well as other ecosystem IP.

## Our People

Our world-class talent is at the heart of everything we do. Together we strive to have a positive effect on business, society, and the planet. Delivering on our strategy and growth ambitions requires attracting, developing, and retaining top talent from across the world. Our people build our technology, unlock new business opportunities, and work with our partners and customers to create global impact.

Fostering a culture of empowerment, inclusion, and accountability is also core to our strategy. We are committed to creating an inclusive workplace where the world's best engineers and technologists can fulfill their dreams and create technology that improves the life of every person on the planet.

## Focus on Innovation and Execution

We are focused on executing our product and process roadmaps and our cadence of innovation. We have set a detailed process and packaging technology roadmap and announced key architectural innovations to further our goal of delivering competitive products in every area in which we compete.

We leverage our Smart Capital approach to help us adjust quickly to opportunities in the market while managing our margin structure and capital spending. The key elements of Smart Capital include:

- Smart capacity investments. We are building out future manufacturing shell space, which gives us flexibility in how and when we bring additional capacity online based on milestone triggers such as product readiness, market conditions, and customer commitments.
- Government incentives. We work with governments to advance and benefit from incentives for domestic manufacturing capacity for leading-edge semiconductors.
- SCIP. We access strategically aligned private capital to increase our flexibility and help efficiently accelerate and scale manufacturing build-outs. Our SCIP program has supported the period of accelerated manufacturing investment that commenced in early 2021. We signed our latest SCIP agreement in the second quarter of 2024 and are not contemplating further transactions in the near term.
- Customer commitments. Our foundry business works closely with potential customers to obtain advance payments to secure capacity and participate in manufacturing capacity build-outs. This provides us with the advantage of committed volume, derisking investments while providing capacity corridors for our foundry customers.
- External foundries. We intend to continue our use of external foundries where their capabilities or capacities support our Intel Products businesses offerings.

## Our Capital

We deploy various forms of capital to execute our strategy in a way that seeks to reflect our corporate values, help our customers succeed, and create value for our stakeholders.

We take a disciplined approach to our financial capital allocation strategy, which continues to focus on building stakeholder value and is driven by our priority to invest in the business. We also seek to optimize our portfolio, look for innovative ways to unlock value across our assets, and, from time-to-time, engage in mergers and acquisitions.

## Cash from Operating Activities $B

## Our Financial Capital Allocation Strategy

## Invest in the Business

Our first allocation priority is to invest in R\&amp;D and capital spending to capitalize on the opportunity presented by the world's demand for semiconductors. In 2024, we continued our focus on capital investment and the deployment of our Smart Capital strategy.

## Return Excess Cash to Stockholders

Our capital allocation strategy historically included returning excess cash to stockholders through dividends and stock repurchases. Our most recent stock repurchase was in the first quarter of 2021 and we suspended the declaration of quarterly dividends starting with the fourth quarter of 2024. We agreed under our commercial CHIPS Act agreement to forgo paying dividends for the next two years, and agreed to limitations on the payment of dividends for the three years thereafter. Further, we do not expect to pay dividends or make stock repurchases until our cash flows improve as we focus on the critical investments needed to execute our business strategy and create long-term value.

## R\&amp;D and Capital Investments $B

<!-- image -->

## Optimize our Portfolio and Unlock Value

We seek to drive value creation through transactions such as the 2022 IPO and 2023 secondary offering of Mobileye stock, the 2023 minority stake sales in IMS, and the 2023 announcement of our intent to operate Altera as a standalone business, which we expect to enable potential private and public equity investments. Transactions like these provide additional capital to support the critical investments needed to advance our business strategy.

Our capital allocation strategy also includes opportunistic investment in and acquisition of companies that complement our strategic objectives. We look for acquisitions that supplement and strengthen our capital and R\&amp;D investments.

Lastly, we take action when investments do not strategically align to our key priorities or provide adequate returns to our stakeholders. In the last few years, we exited numerous businesses, including our NAND Memory business (first closing in 2021 and second closing expected in March 2025) and our Intel  Optane™ memory business \(2022\). ®

- See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" within MD\&amp;A. 1
- 2021-2024 capital investments in Memory are not presented due to the divestiture of the NAND memory business which we deconsolidated upon closing the first phase of the transaction on December 29, 2021. 2020 capital investments presented include Memory. 2

## Research and Development

R\&amp;D investment is critical to enable us to deliver on our technology roadmap, introduce leading products, and develop new businesses and capabilities in the future. We seek to protect our R\&amp;D efforts through our IP rights and may augment R\&amp;D initiatives by, from time-to-time, acquiring or investing in companies, entering into R\&amp;D agreements, and directly purchasing or licensing technology.

## Areas Key to Product Competitiveness

We have intensified our focus and investment on areas key to product competitiveness. Our objective with each new generation of products is to improve user experiences and value through advances in performance, power, cost, connectivity, security, form factor, and other features. We also focus on reducing our design complexity, re-using IP, and increasing ecosystem collaboration to improve our efficiency.

xPU. We believe the future is with xPU across a diverse mix of scalar, vector, matrix, and spatial architectures deployed in CPU, GPU, NPU, IPU, accelerators, and FPGA sockets, enabled by a scalable software stack and integrated into systems by advanced packaging technology. We are building processors that span several major computing architectures, moving toward an era of heterogeneous computing:

- Client CPUs. In 2024, we ramped sales of the Intel Core™ Ultra Series 1, our first product with an integrated neural processing unit for efficient processing of AI workload. The Intel Core Ultra Series 1, manufactured on the Intel 4 process, introduced the first AI PCs to the market. We also launched the Intel Core Ultra 200V Series, showcasing power efficiency and long-lasting battery life. The 200V Series, manufactured by an external foundry, leverages our Xe2 GPU architecture, bringing improved efficiency, second-generation ray tracing units and XMX AI acceleration to thin and light notebooks. During 2024, a significant majority of our client sales consisted of our 13th and 14th Gen Intel Core processors, manufactured on Intel 7, which allow us to serve the breadth of customer and computing needs in the client market. ®
- Data center CPUs. We launched our Intel Xeon  6 processors for the data center, utilizing the Intel 3 process, including our first Intel Xeon processor using Efficient cores (E-cores). The Intel Xeon 6 family is designed to address the growing diversity in workloads and deployments in the data center environments. Our 5th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors, based on Intel 7, were launched in 2023, and continued to ramp throughout 2024. ® ®
- Discrete client GPUs. The Intel Arc™ graphics family offers modern GPU features to power immersive games, creator applications, and AI workloads. In 2024, we launched the Intel Arc B-Series based on the latest Xe2 GPU architecture. The compute engine of the Intel Arc B-Series is our second-generation X -core, which delivers 70\% more performance per core and is 50\% more power efficient than the Intel Arc A750. ® e
- Edge computing. We recently launched a suite of processors for edge computing. This includes the Intel Core Ultra 200S Series, bringing the NPU IP to desktops and reducing package power. These hybrid designs utilize our most advanced performance cores and power-efficient cores, as well as the latest packaging technology.
- Datacenter AI accelerators and GPUs. In 2024, we launched the Intel Gaudi  3 AI accelerators offering significant price-performance advantages for AI inference applications. ® ®

Software. Software unleashes the potential of our hardware platforms across all workloads, domains, and architectures.

We aim to optimize AI frameworks and middleware, such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, vLLM, Hugging Face and WebNN to run efficiently on our hardware. Our OpenVINO™ toolkit is an open source toolkit that accelerates deep learning inference on our processors across various use cases, such as generative AI, computer vision, audio, and language with industry standard models. It is used in domains from edge to AI PC to cloud and is the leading inferencing library on our silicon.

In 2024 we launched the Open Platform for Enterprise AI under the Linux Foundation to accelerate deployment of generative AI use cases through industry standard modular microservice architecture. Since launch, the ecosystem has been actively engaged, with an expanding network of partners enhancing features and developing new capabilities.

Most of these frameworks and middleware are built from our oneAPI, which enables developers to create performant cross-architecture applications using a single code base across CPUs, GPUs, and other accelerators. We contributed our oneAPI specifications and implementations to the UXL Foundation under the Linux Foundation. By doing so, oneAPI delivers an open and multi-vendor programming model enabling choice and code re-use across the accelerator hardware ecosystem.

This software stack is designed to preserve the usability of existing tools and software while accommodating future developments, enabling continuity for users and developers.

## Areas Key to Process and Packaging Competitiveness

Our leading-edge process and packaging technology continues to be key to the success of our strategy.

- Intel 7 process node continues in production for our 13th and 14th Gen Intel Core processors. Intel 7 was utilized for a significant majority of our processor production and products in 2024, and is expected to continue to be utilized for a significant portion of our processor production and products in 2025.

- Intel 4, our first EUV lithography node, delivers significant density scaling and approximately 20\% performance-per-watt improvement over Intel 7. The Intel Core Ultra processor is our first high-volume client product on Intel 4 and began shipping to customers in 2023. Intel 4 moved to high-volume manufacturing in Ireland in 2024, and is expected to represent an increasing portion of our processor production and products in 2025.
- Intel 3, our second EUV lithography node, delivers further logic scaling and up to 18\% performance-per-watt improvement over Intel 4. Intel 3 is offered to external foundry customers and is optimized for the needs of data center products. This node, which is produced in the same facilities as Intel 4, was in high-volume manufacturing in Oregon during 2024, with high-volume manufacturing shifted to Ireland for 2025. Intel's Xeon 6 Scalable server processor offerings are built on this technology.
- Intel 18A is our next generation leading-edge process technology and has been designed to incorporate the first high volume commercial implementation of two breakthrough technologies: gate-all-around transistors and backside power. RibbonFET, our implementation of a gate-all-around transistor, is designed to deliver faster transistor switching speeds while achieving the same drive current as multiple fins, but in a smaller footprint. PowerVia is our unique industry-first implementation of backside power delivery that is designed to optimize signal transmission by eliminating the need for power routing on the front side of the wafer. Intel 18A is offered to external foundry customers and is designed to deliver improvements in performance per watt and density scaling over Intel 3. We expect to commence high-volume manufacturing of Panther Lake, our new client family of products and our first processors on Intel 18A, in 2025.
- Intel 14A, our third advanced process technology offering to external customers, is in active development with performance-per-watt and density scaling improvements over Intel 18A.

## IP Rights

We own and develop significant IP and related IP rights around the world that support our products, services, R\&amp;D, and other activities and assets. Our IP portfolio includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, mask works, and other rights. We actively seek to protect our global IP rights and deter unauthorized use of our IP and other assets.

We have obtained patents in the US and other countries. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire, and in some cases our products may be obsolete before the patents are granted. As we expand our product offerings, particularly around our foundry business, we also seek to extend our patent development efforts. In addition to developing patents based on our own R\&amp;D efforts, we may purchase or license patents from third parties.

The software that we distribute, including software embedded in our products, is entitled to copyright and other IP protection. To distinguish our products from our competitors' products, we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products, and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine Intel components. We also protect details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.

Efforts to protect our IP can be difficult, particularly in countries that provide less protection to IP rights and in the absence of harmonized international IP standards. Competitors and others may already have IP rights covering similar products. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain IP rights covering our own products or that we will be able to obtain IP licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all. For a discussion of IP-related risks, see "Risk Factors" within Risk Factors and Other Key Information. While our IP rights are important to our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any single patent, copyright, or other IP right.

We are one of only a few companies in the world with the process technology and manufacturing facilities to produce leading-edge semiconductor logic chips.

## Process Technology

Our technology development group, with its R\&amp;D and semiconductor fabrication facilities in Oregon, designs and develops each new process technology node before highvolume production is shifted to one of our high-volume manufacturing sites. With each new node, we seek improvements in performance, power efficiency, cost, and size to meet the needs of our products and of external foundry customers. The continued development of leading-edge nodes that are competitive with the offerings of other foundries requires significant ongoing capital investment as we pursue incremental improvements and refinements of existing transistor and layout designs and manufacturing technologies, such as EUV lithography, while also pursuing new transistor and layout designs, such as gate-all-around and backside power in our upcoming Intel 18A process node, and new manufacturing technologies, such as high-NA EUV lithography for use in our upcoming Intel 14A process node.

As of the end of 2024, a significant majority of our products were manufactured using our Intel 7 process node in Arizona and Israel, we successfully ramped our Intel 4 and Intel 3 process nodes as our first EUV lithography nodes and shifted high-volume production of those nodes to Ireland, and we canceled the productization of our Intel 20A process node to focus efforts on the improved version of the node, Intel 18A, that we expect to put into high-volume production in 2025 with our new client family of products code-named Panther Lake.

Unrealized gains (losses) on non-marketable investments includes observable price adjustments and our share of equity method investee gains (losses) and certain distributions. 1

## Gains (Losses) on Equity Investments, Net

In 2024, we recognized net gains on equity investments of \$242 million primarily due to \$460 million of net gains related to our marketable equity investment portfolio, the majority of which related to the sale of our interest in Astera Labs and is within realized gains (losses) on sales of equity investments, net .

In 2023, we recognized net gains on equity investments of \$40 million primarily due to \$213 million of net gains related to our marketable equity investment portfolio, substantially all of which is within realized gains (losses) on sales of equity investments, net.

## Interest and Other, Net

In 2024, interest and other, net decreased primarily due to higher interest expense due to higher 2024 average borrowings and lower other, net . Included in other, net in 2024 is a loss of \$755 million from the change in fair value of a non-designated derivative related to our assessed probability of paying construction-related liquidated damages to Apollo, our Ireland SCIP partner. In 2024, we also received and recognized \$560 million as a benefit to other, net for interest in relation to the European Commission competition matter for which we recorded and paid a ruling amount to the European Commission in 2009 and that we were successful at challenging and overturning with the ruling amount refunded to us in 2022.

## Provision for (Benefit from) Taxes

| Years Ended ($ In Millions)        | Dec 28, 2024   | Dec 30, 2023   | Dec 31, 2022   |
|------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Income (loss) before taxes         | $ (11,210)     | $ 762          | $ 7,768        |
| Provision for (benefit from) taxes | $ 8,023        | $ \(913\)        | $ \(249\)        |

Our effective tax rate increased in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by the effects associated with the establishment of a valuation allowance against our US federal deferred tax assets in 2024. We assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets quarterly, weighing available positive and negative evidence. As a result of our assessment in the third quarter of 2024, we determined it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be recoverable based upon our three-year cumulative historical loss position as of the third quarter of 2024, largely resulting from the asset impairment and restructuring and other charges incurred during the third quarter of 2024. Additionally, our 2024 provision for taxes and 2023 benefit from taxes included R\&amp;D tax credits, which provide a tax benefit based on our eligible R\&amp;D spending and are not dependent on lower income before taxes.

## Liquidity and Capital Resources

We believe we have sufficient sources of funding to meet our business requirements for the next 12 months and in the longer term. Cash generated by operations, and total cash and short-term investments as shown in the table below, are our primary sources of liquidity for funding our strategic business requirements. These sources are further supplemented by our committed credit facilities and other borrowing capacity and certain other Smart Capital initiatives that we have undertaken, including our Ireland SCIP transaction that closed in the second quarter of 2024 that resulted in \$11.0 billion of net cash inflows to us (see "Note 4: Non-Controlling Interests" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our short-term funding requirements include capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test, including investments in our process technology roadmap; investments in our product roadmap; working capital requirements, including cash outlays associated with the 2024 Restructuring Plan; partner distributions to our non-controlling interest holders; and strategic investments. We expect reductions in operating expenditures, capital expenditures, and cost of sales after implementing our 2024 Restructuring Plan and related cost-reduction measures, including reductions in headcount, which are designed to enable further operational efficiency and agility and create capacity for sustained investment in technology and manufacturing competitiveness. Our long-term funding requirements incrementally contemplate investments in significant manufacturing expansion plans and investments to accelerate our process technology. These plans include expanding existing operations in Arizona, New Mexico, and Oregon, and investing in a new leading-edge manufacturing facility in Ohio. They may also include longer-term projects, certain of which we have currently put on hold or slowed the completion of, including a new leading-edge manufacturing facility, a new assembly and test facility, and a new advanced packaging facility, among others.

We entered into government incentive arrangements with the US federal government pursuant to the CHIPS Act. In September 2024, we were awarded up to \$3.0 billion in direct funding for the Secure Enclave program to expand the trusted manufacturing of leading-edge semiconductors for the US government. In November 2024, we signed a Direct Funding Agreement with the US Department of Commerce for the award of \$7.9 billion in government incentives pursuant to the CHIPS Act, and we received \$1.1 billion of cash in 2024 and have received an additional \$1.1 billion of cash in 2025. We expect to continue to benefit from government incentives, though recent US government actions create uncertainty as to the receipt of awards under our existing CHIPS Act agreements and the potential for future awards in the US. These incentives typically require that we make significant capital investments in new facilities or expand existing facilities and our related workforce. To the extent we delay or cancel any such projects or otherwise are unable or fail to comply with the terms of the agreements, there may be a delay in our receipt of, or we may forfeit or be required to repay, the associated government incentives.

We expect to adjust the cadence of our investments based on the execution of our roadmap and changing business conditions. As of December 28, 2024, we had commitments for capital expenditures of \$14.0 billion for 2025 and had \$6.0 billion in capital expenditures committed in the long term. As of December 28, 2024, other purchase obligations and commitments in 2025 under our binding commitments for purchases of goods and services were \$2.1 billion, with an additional \$4.9 billion committed in the long term.

We have additional obligations as part of our ordinary course of business, beyond those committed for capital expenditures and other purchase obligations and commitments for purchases of goods and services. For example, see: "Note 4: Non-Controlling Interests" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our SCIP arrangements and variable distribution payments that we expect to make to our co-investment partners, including liquidated damage provisions should we fail to meet certain construction milestones or operational metrics; "Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our lease obligations, which include supply agreements structured as leases; "Note 8: Income Taxes" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our tax obligations, including impacts from Tax Reform enacted in 2017 for the one-time transition tax on previously untaxed foreign earnings; and "Note 13: Borrowings" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our debt obligations. The expected timing of payments of our obligations is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. In addition, some of our purchasing requirements are not current obligations and are therefore not included in the amounts above. For example, some of these requirements are not handled through binding contracts or are fulfilled by vendors on a purchase order basis within short time horizons.

When assessing our current sources of liquidity, we include our total cash and short-term investments as follows:

| (In Millions)                         | Dec 28, 2024   | Dec 30, 2023   |
|---------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Cash and cash equivalents             | $ 8,249        | $ 7,079        |
| Short-term investments                | 13,813         | 17,955         |
| Total cash and short-term investments | $ 22,062       | $ 25,034       |
| Total debt                            | $ 50,011       | $ 49,266       |

We suspended the declaration of quarterly dividends starting with Q4 2024. We are prohibited under our commercial CHIPS Act agreement from paying dividends for the next two years and are subject to limitations on the payment of dividends for the three years thereafter. Further, we do not expect to pay dividends until our cash flows improve as we focus on the critical investments needed to execute our business strategy and create long-term value.

During 2024, we issued a total of \$2.6 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes and remarketed \$438 million aggregate principal amount of other bonds for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, refinancing of outstanding debt and funding for working capital and capital expenditures. During 2024, we also expanded both our 5-year \$5.0 billion revolving credit facility agreement and our 364-day \$5.0 billion credit facility agreement, to \$7.0 billion and \$8.0 billion, respectively, and the maturity dates were extended to February 2029 and January 2025, respectively. In January 2025, we amended our 364-day \$8.0 billion credit facility agreement to \$5.0 billion, and the maturity date was extended by one year to January 2026. We have other potential sources of liquidity, including our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. Under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to \$10.0 billion. As of December 28, 2024, we had no commercial paper obligations outstanding and no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facilities. See "Note 13: Borrowings" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Our total cash and investments and related cash flows may be affected by certain discretionary actions we may take with customers and suppliers to accelerate or delay certain cash receipts or payments to manage liquidity, among other factors, for our strategic business requirements. In 2024, these actions included, among others, negotiating with suppliers to optimize our payment terms and conditions, adjusting the amounts and timing of cash flows associated with customer sales programs and collections, managing inventory levels and purchasing practices, and selling certain of our accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions. While such actions have benefited, and may further benefit, cash flow in the near term, we may experience a corresponding detriment to cash flow in future periods as these actions cease or as the impacts of these actions reverse or normalize.

We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments were in investment-grade securities in 2024.

Cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities were as follows:

| Years Ended (In Millions)                            | Dec 28, 2024   | Dec 30, 2023   | Dec 31, 2022   |
|------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Net cash provided by (used for) operating activities | $ 8,288        | $ 11,471       | $ 15,433       |
| Net cash provided by (used for) investing activities | (18,256)       | (24,041)       | (10,231)       |
| Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities | 11,138         | 8,505          | 1,115          |
| Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents | $ 1,170        | $ (4,065)      | $ 6,317        |

## Operating Activities

Operating cash flows consist of net income (loss) adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities.

Cash provided by operations in 2024 was lower compared to 2023 by \$3.2 billion as we incurred a net loss in 2024 that was fully offset by a higher amount of favorable operating cash flow adjustments for non-cash items like depreciation, share-based compensation, and restructuring and other expenses, compared to net income in 2023 with lower favorable operating cash flow adjustments.

## Investing Activities

Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; proceeds from capital-related government incentives; and proceeds from divestitures and cash used for acquisitions. Our investing capital expenditures were \$23.9 billion in 2024 (\$25.8 billion in 2023 and \$24.8 billion in 2022).

The decrease in cash used for investing activities in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to lower purchases of short-term investments, lower capital expenditures, higher proceeds from capital-related government incentives, and higher sales of equity investments. These 2024 cash favorable activities were partially offset by lower maturities and sales of short-term investments and higher 2024 cash used in other investing activities.

## Financing Activities

Financing cash flows consist primarily of proceeds from strategic initiatives, including partner contributions and equity-related issuances, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, financing for capital expenditures with non-standard payment terms, and payment of dividends to stockholders.

The increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to higher SCIP partner contributions, reduced dividend payments, and other cash favorable financing activities in 2024. These 2024 cash favorable financing activities were partially offset by lower proceeds from debt issuances, net of repayments; the absence of proceeds from sales of subsidiary shares; and higher financing for capital expenditures with non-standard payment terms in 2024.

## Concentration of Revenue

In 2024, substantially all of the revenue from our three largest customers was from the sale of platforms and other components by our Intel Products operating segments. Our three largest customers accounted for the following percentage of our net revenue:

| Years Ended                     | Dec 28, 2024   | Dec 30, 2023   | Dec 31, 2022   |

| Total percentage of net revenue | 45\%            | 40\%            | 42\%            |

Net revenue by region, based on the billing location of the customer, was as follows:

## Semiconductor Co-Investment Program

## Ireland SCIP

In the second quarter of 2024, we closed a transaction with Apollo Global Management, Inc. (Apollo) involving the sale of 49\% of our interest in an Irish limited liability company (Ireland SCIP) for net proceeds of \$11.0 billion, which increased our capital in excess of par value. Ireland SCIP is a VIE that we consolidate into our Consolidated Financial Statements because we are the primary beneficiary. Generally, distributions will be received from Ireland SCIP based on both parties' proportional ownership. Ireland SCIP has the rights to operate Fab 34 in Leixlip, Ireland, and has the rights to the related factory output. We have the right to purchase 100\% of the related factory output from Ireland SCIP. We will retain sole ownership of Fab 34, will be engaged as the Fab 34 operator in exchange for variable payments from Ireland SCIP based on the related factory output, and will be required to maintain certain performance standards in our capacity as operator.

We are required to substantially complete construction of Fab 34 in accordance with contractual parameters and timelines or we will be required to pay delay-related liquidated damages to Apollo beginning in 2026, not to exceed \$1.1 billion in total. As of December 28, 2024, we expect certain construction milestones for Fab 34 will be delayed as we refined our near-term production capacity requirements and related capital outlays relative to those that are required per the Ireland SCIP agreement. As a result, in 2024 we recognized a loss of \$755 million within Interest and other, net from the change in fair value of the liquidated damage provisions, which qualify as a non-designated derivative. Refer to "Note 16: Derivative Financial Instruments" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Though we expect certain construction delays in the near term, we intend to complete construction of Fab 34. We will be required to purchase minimum quantities of the related factory output from Ireland SCIP, or we will be subject to pay certain volume-related damages to Ireland SCIP, beginning at the earlier of when construction is complete or Q3 2027.

As of December 28, 2024, other than cash and cash equivalents held by Ireland SCIP, substantially all of the remaining assets and liabilities of Ireland SCIP were eliminated in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

## Arizona SCIP

We consolidate the results of an Arizona limited liability company (Arizona SCIP), a VIE, into our Consolidated Financial Statements because we are the primary beneficiary. Generally, contributions will be made to, and distributions will be received from Arizona SCIP based on Intel's and Brookfield Asset Management's (Brookfield's) proportional ownership. We will be the sole operator and main beneficiary of two new chip factories that will be constructed by Arizona SCIP, and we will have the right to purchase 100\% of the related factory output. Once production commences, we will be required to both operate Arizona SCIP at minimum production levels (measured in wafer starts per week) and limit excess inventory held on site or we will be subject to certain damages.

We have an unrecognized commitment to fund our respective share of the total construction costs of Arizona SCIP. The total construction costs were estimated at \$29.0 billion when we entered into the definitive agreement with Brookfield in 2022.

As of December 28, 2024, substantially all of the assets of Arizona SCIP consisted of property, plant, and equipment. The remaining assets and liabilities of Arizona SCIP were eliminated in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The assets held by Arizona SCIP, which can be used only to settle obligations of the VIE and are not available to us, were \$11.5 billion as of December 28, 2024 (\$4.8 billion as of December 30, 2023).

## Mobileye

In 2022, Mobileye completed its IPO and certain other equity financing transactions. During 2023, we converted 38.5 million of our Mobileye Class B shares into Class A shares, representing 5\% of Mobileye's outstanding capital stock, and subsequently sold the Class A shares for \$42 per share as part of a secondary offering, receiving net proceeds of \$1.6 billion and increasing our capital in excess of par value by \$663 million, net of tax. We continue to consolidate the results of Mobileye into our Consolidated Financial Statements. In the third quarter of 2024, the non-cash impairment of goodwill related to our Mobileye reporting unit was attributed to Intel and to non-controlling interest holders based on our proportional ownership (see "Note 11: Goodwill" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

## IMS Nanofabrication

In 2023, we closed agreements to sell a combined 32\% minority stake in our IMS business, a business within our Intel Foundry operating segment-including a 20\% stake to Bain Capital Special Situations and a 10\% stake to TSMC. Net proceeds resulting from the minority stake sales totaled \$1.4 billion, and our capital in excess of par value increased by \$958 million, net of tax. We continue to consolidate the results of IMS into our Consolidated Financial Statements.
