Notwithstanding the above, under the federal Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, you shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under federal or state trade
secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that: (a) is made in confidence to an attorney or to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or
indirectly, and is solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; (b) is made to your attorney in relation to a lawsuit for retaliation
against you for reporting a suspected violation of law; or (c) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding filed by you, if such
document is filed (i) under seal in any lawsuit or proceeding, and (ii) pursuant to court order in any retaliation lawsuit filed by you. Nothing in this Agreement is
intended to conflict with 18 U.S.C. § 1833(b) or create liability for disclosures of trade secrets that are expressly allowed by such section. Further, nothing in this
Agreement or any other agreement you have with Intel shall prohibit or restrict you from (a) voluntarily communicating with an attorney retained by you; (b)
making any voluntary disclosure of information or documents to (including for purposes of filing a charge, complaint or report with), or otherwise initiating,
cooperating with or participating in any investigation or proceeding conducted by, any law enforcement, governmental agency (including, without limitation, the
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”), and the National Labor Relations Board) or
legislative body, any state or local commission on human rights (including, without limitation, the California Civil Rights Department) or any self-regulatory
organization, in each case, without advance notice to Intel; (c) disclosing any information to a court or other administrative or legislative body in response to a
subpoena, court order or written request; (d) seeking and obtaining payment or an award from the SEC, pursuant to Section 21F of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, or obtaining any other “whistleblower” award, to the extent such right cannot by law be waived; or (e) discussing or disclosing information
about unlawful acts in the workplace, such as harassment or discrimination, or any other conduct that you have reason to believe is unlawful.

property (files, documents, laptops, company-issued phones, tablets, keys, credit cards, etc.) and any and all Intel Confidential Information and property in your
possession (with the exception of my personnel documents). With respect to Company-issued phones, laptops and tablets, you instead may elect to retain all
such devices provided that, during the above 10 day period, you provide reasonable access to Company IT employees for the purpose of removing all
Company confidential information.
