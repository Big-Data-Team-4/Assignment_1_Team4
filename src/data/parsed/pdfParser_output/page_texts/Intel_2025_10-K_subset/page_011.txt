Gains (Losses) on Equity Investments, Net
In 2024, we recognized net gains on equity investments of $242 million primarily due to $460 million of net gains related to our marketable equity investment portfolio, the
majority of which related to the sale of our interest in Astera Labs and is within realized gains (losses) on sales of equity investments, net.
In 2023, we recognized net gains on equity investments of $40 million primarily due to $213 million of net gains related to our marketable equity investment portfolio, substantially
all of which is within realized gains (losses) on sales of equity investments, net.
Interest and Other, Net
In 2024, interest and other, net decreased primarily due to higher interest expense due to higher 2024 average borrowings and lower other, net. Included in other, net in 2024 is a
loss of $755 million from the change in fair value of a non-designated derivative related to our assessed probability of paying construction-related liquidated damages to Apollo,
our Ireland SCIP partner. In 2024, we also received and recognized $560 million as a benefit to other, net for interest in relation to the European Commission competition matter
for which we recorded and paid a ruling amount to the European Commission in 2009 and that we were successful at challenging and overturning with the ruling amount
refunded to us in 2022.

Effective tax rate

(119.8)%
(3.2)%
Our effective tax rate increased in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by the effects associated with the establishment of a valuation allowance against our US federal
deferred tax assets in 2024. We assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets quarterly, weighing available positive and negative evidence. As a result of our assessment
in the third quarter of 2024, we determined it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be recoverable based upon our three-year cumulative historical loss
position as of the third quarter of 2024, largely resulting from the asset impairment and restructuring and other charges incurred during the third quarter of 2024. Additionally, our
2024 provision for taxes and 2023 benefit from taxes included R&D tax credits, which provide a tax benefit based on our eligible R&D spending and are not dependent on lower
income before taxes.
