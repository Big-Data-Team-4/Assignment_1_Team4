During 2024, we issued a total of $2.6 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes and remarketed $438 million aggregate principal amount of other bonds for general
corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, refinancing of outstanding debt and funding for working capital and capital expenditures. During 2024, we also expanded both
our 5-year $5.0 billion revolving credit facility agreement and our 364-day $5.0 billion credit facility agreement, to $7.0 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively, and the maturity dates
were extended to February 2029 and January 2025, respectively. In January 2025, we amended our 364-day $8.0 billion credit facility agreement to $5.0 billion, and the maturity
date was extended by one year to January 2026. We have other potential sources of liquidity, including our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration
statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. Under our commercial paper program, we have an
ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $10.0 billion. As of December 28, 2024, we had no commercial paper obligations outstanding and no
outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facilities. See "Note 13: Borrowings" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Our total cash and investments and related cash flows may be affected by certain discretionary actions we may take with customers and suppliers to accelerate or delay certain
cash receipts or payments to manage liquidity, among other factors, for our strategic business requirements. In 2024, these actions included, among others, negotiating with
suppliers to optimize our payment terms and conditions, adjusting the amounts and timing of cash flows associated with customer sales programs and collections, managing
inventory levels and purchasing practices, and selling certain of our accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions. While such actions have
benefited, and may further benefit, cash flow in the near term, we may experience a corresponding detriment to cash flow in future periods as these actions cease or as the
impacts of these actions reverse or normalize.
We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments were in
investment-grade securities in 2024.

Operating Activities
Operating cash flows consist of net income (loss) adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities.
Cash provided by operations in 2024 was lower compared to 2023 by $3.2 billion as we incurred a net loss in 2024 that was fully offset by a higher amount of favorable operating
cash flow adjustments for non-cash items like depreciation, share-based compensation, and restructuring and other expenses, compared to net income in 2023 with lower
favorable operating cash flow adjustments.
Investing Activities
Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; proceeds from capital-related government incentives; and
proceeds from divestitures and cash used for acquisitions. Our investing capital expenditures were $23.9 billion in 2024 ($25.8 billion in 2023 and $24.8 billion in 2022).
The decrease in cash used for investing activities in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to lower purchases of short-term investments, lower capital expenditures, higher
proceeds from capital-related government incentives, and higher sales of equity investments. These 2024 cash favorable activities were partially offset by lower maturities and
sales of short-term investments and higher 2024 cash used in other investing activities.
Financing Activities
Financing cash flows consist primarily of proceeds from strategic initiatives, including partner contributions and equity-related issuances, issuance and repayment of short-term
and long-term debt, financing for capital expenditures with non-standard payment terms, and payment of dividends to stockholders.
The increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to higher SCIP partner contributions, reduced dividend payments, and other
cash favorable financing activities in 2024. These 2024 cash favorable financing activities were partially offset by lower proceeds from debt issuances, net of repayments; the
absence of proceeds from sales of subsidiary shares; and higher financing for capital expenditures with non-standard payment terms in 2024.
