Delivering leadership products
We seek to develop and offer leading products that will help enable a future in which every human can have more computing power and quicker access to data. We remain
committed to our goal of delivering five technology nodes in four years to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025. This year, we achieved
several key milestones on our product roadmap, including:
▪
We launched the Intel  Core™ Ultra processors, featuring our first integrated neural processing unit, for power-efficient AI acceleration and local inference on the PC.
▪
We introduced the 13th Gen Intel  Core™ mobile processor family, led by the launch of the first 24-core processor for laptops, and introduced the new Intel vPro
Platform powered by the full lineup of 13th Gen Intel Core processors.
▪
We introduced the 14th Gen Intel  Core™ desktop processor family, delivering fast desktop frequencies and enhanced desktop experience for enthusiasts.
▪
We launched the 4th Gen Intel  Xeon  Scalable processors, a critical part of our heterogeneous hardware and software portfolio to accelerate real-world data center,
cloud and edge workloads, including AI, and also launched the 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors with Intel  vRAN Boost, a new general-purpose chip that fully
integrates Layer 1 acceleration into the Xeon SoC and is designed to eliminate the need for external accelerator cards.
▪
We launched the 5th Gen Intel  Xeon  Scalable processors for data center, cloud, and edge, with embedded capabilities for powering AI workloads.
▪
We introduced two new Intel  Arc™ Pro Graphics Processing Units, Intel Arc Pro A60 and Intel Pro A60M, and shipped Intel Arc Pro A40-based systems.
Investing in leading-edge, at-scale manufacturing
We are committed to strengthening the resilience of the global semiconductor supply chain for leading-edge semiconductor products by investing in geographically balanced
manufacturing capacity. In the US, we are expanding our existing operations in Arizona, New Mexico, and Oregon, and investing in two new leading-edge chip factories in Ohio.
We have submitted all four of our major project proposals in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon, estimated to represent over $100 billion of US manufacturing and research
investments over the next five years, to the US Department of Commerce's CHIPS Program Office.
In the European Union and Israel, we have announced a series of investments, spanning our existing operations in Ireland and Israel, as well as our planned investment of more
than $33 billion in Germany to build a leading-edge wafer fabrication mega-site, and our plans to invest up to $4.6 billion in an assembly and test facility in Poland. We also
announced the start of high-volume manufacturing using Intel 4 technology and EUV technology in Ireland.
Unlocking value
We continue to look for innovative ways to unlock value for our stakeholders. We sold a 32.4% minority stake in our IMS Nanofabrication business, including investments from
Bain Capital and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). Net proceeds resulting from the IMS minority stake sales totaled $1.4 billion. We also executed a
secondary offering of Mobileye stock that generated net proceeds of $1.6 billion. Further, we communicated our intent to operate our Programmable Solutions Group (PSG) as a
standalone business, with standalone financial reporting beginning January 1, 2024. This is expected to enable potential private and public equity investments. These
transactions provide an additional source of capital to support the critical investments needed to advance our strategy.
