Organization of Our Form 10-K
The order and presentation of content in our Form 10-K differs from the traditional SEC Form 10-K format. Our format is designed to improve readability and better present how
we organize and manage our business. See "Form 10-K Cross-Reference Index" within the Financial Statements and Supplemental Details for a cross-reference index to the
traditional SEC Form 10-K format.
We have defined certain terms and abbreviations used throughout our Form 10-K in "Key Terms" within the Financial Statements and Supplemental Details.
The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements is in conformity with US GAAP. Our Form 10-K includes key metrics that we use to measure our business, some of
which are non-GAAP measures. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" within MD&A for an explanation of these measures and why management uses them and believes they
provide investors with useful supplemental information.
