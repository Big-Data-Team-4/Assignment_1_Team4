A Year in Review
2023 revenue was $54.2 billion, down $8.8 billion, or 14%, from 2022. CCG revenue decreased 8% due to lower notebook and desktop
volume from lower demand across market segments, partially offset by increased volume in the second half of the year as customer
inventory levels normalized compared to higher levels in the first half. Notebook ASPs decreased due to a higher mix of small core
products combined with a higher mix of older generation products. This was partially offset by higher desktop ASPs due to an increased
mix of product sales to the commercial and gaming market segments. DCAI revenue decreased 20% due to lower server volume
resulting from a softening CPU data center market, partially offset by higher ASPs from a lower mix of hyperscale customer-related
revenue and a higher mix of high core count products. NEX revenue decreased 31% as customers tempered purchases to reduce
inventories and adjust to a lower demand environment across product lines. We invested $16.0 billion in R&D, made capital investments
of $25.8 billion, and had $11.5 billion in cash from operations and $(11.9) billion of adjusted free cash flow.

Managing to our long-term financial model
Our 2023 results reflect the continued advancement of our transformational journey. We continued to prioritize investments critical to our IDM 2.0 transformation, achieved
operational milestones, and executed disciplined expense management. To achieve our long-term financial model, we believe it is imperative that we drive to world-class product
cost and operational efficiency. A key component of our overall strategy is our internal foundry model. Under this model, we intend to reshape our operational dynamics and
establish transparency and accountability through standalone profit and loss reporting for our manufacturing group in 2024. We expect this model to enable increased efficiencies
across a number of aspects of our organization that we believe are integral to achieving our financial and operational goals. At the same time, we continue to prioritize capital
investments critical to our efforts to regain process leadership and establish a leading-edge, at-scale foundry business.
